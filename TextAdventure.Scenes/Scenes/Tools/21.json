    "description": "With the wolf-monster that has terrorised Lupraviafor so many years lying dead at your feet at last, you become aware of something flapping at the window of the Count's chambers.\nYou gasp, truly taken aback to see a striking, platinum haired woman, with skin as white as ivory, wrapped in a black cloak, suspended in the cold night air beyond the glas \u2014 the Countess Isolde of Maun.\nA cruel smile spreads across her blood-red lips revealing the points of elongated fangs and she transfixes you once more her mesmerising stare.\nYou cannot help yourself as, compelled by a persuasive voice inside your head, you step forward, open the window, and invite the Countess into the tower chamber.\n'Well done, my pet', she purrs.\n'You served me well'.  \n'Ever since the days of the Cadre Infernal I have sought power over these lands, but thanks to the ritual we enacted that night, so many years ago, Count Varcolac of the ruling House of Wulfen has had power over me and the offers'.\n'For as long he lived, and the demon protected him, I could not act against him, nor could Serpensa, the widow Aranaea, or the Abbot'.\n'But now that you, one of his own line, have deposed him, I am free to take up the reins of power ande seize control of Lupravia'.\n\nYou are in the thrall of the vampiric Lady of Maun, and have been ever since she bewitched you in her tower.\nSo it is that there is nothing you can do to stop her; you are utterly under her control.\nCount Varcolac may be gone, but Lupravia will remain in the grip of evil, now under the rule of the House Of Maun and the Vampiress Isolde.\nYou will serve her loyally, as her wolf-thrall.\nWhen it seemed that, against all the odds, you had beaten the Curse of the Werewolf, the Curse of the Vampire has thwarted you at the last.\nYou have failed in your mission.",
