    "description": "Emerging from the tunnel, you enter a vast chamber - a natural stone cathedral deep within the rock of Sundered Peak.\nHanging amid the stalactites suspended from the roof of the cavern are pendulous, silk-wrapped egg-sacs, like those made by spiders, although each of these is as big as a treasure chest.\nAs you cross the chamber, you detect movement above you.\nLooking up into the gloom you see several of the scas split open and the giant spider hatchlings emerge.\nEach has a distinctive set of markings on its abdomen, in the form of a grinning Death's Head, and each hatches with the instinctive desire to hunt!",
