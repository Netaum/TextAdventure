Your agonised cry is suddenly joined by a howl of pain as the wolf releases its grip. 
Your vision greying, you see a tall, thickset figure standing over the Black Wolf, a sturdy woodsman's axe raised above his head. 
The axe descends again and the wolf pives a strangled yowl and leaps off you. 
The woodsman swings his axe again and the wolf flees yelping, the rest of the pack skulking after their leader. 
Then the great figure is looming over you.
Defeated by pain and blood loss, your body cannot take any more and you black out.
