"Maybe not", Ulrich says, fixing you with an unnerving stare.
There is something old and forbidding about the dark pits of his eyes, as if there is something else looking out of Ulrich at you. 
"There may still be hope for you."
"There is? Then what is to be done?" 
You press the woodsman to tell you more.

"I know of two cures for lycanthropy, but we will have to act quickly". 
Ulrich will help you? 
But why? 
"Let us just say that we all have our secrets.‚Äù 
"So what are the cures?"
"The surest way, is to find lhe werewolf that infected you with its bite, and kill it." 
"You could also eat a sprig of the herb belladonna, if you could find some." 
"And there is one other course of action we could take." 
"We could seek the assistance of Grandmother Zekova, the wisest person I know, who lives further into these woods, over the border in Lupravia.""
"But it is up to you."
