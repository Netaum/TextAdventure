As you battle the Black Wolf you become increasingly aware of the rest of the wolf pack continuing to close in around you, and that momentary distraction is all it takes. 
You stumble on an exposed root and lose your foating. 
The huge wolf seizes the opportunity withunnerving animal cunning. 
Your sword-arm flailing as you try to maintain your balance, the wolf smashes through your compromised defence and hurls bodily to the ground. 
You feel its great weight on top of you, the breath knocked out of you. 
You can smell its fetid, carnivoreâ€™s breath, hear its snarl in your ear.
And then, with a savage cry of animal satisfacton, the wolf sinks its fangs into the flesh of your shoulder.
